# Functional-Programming-in-Javascript

This Presentation helps us to understand what is functional programming and its concepts.

I have created simple examples in plunker to walk through

# Key concepts are
1. Imperative vs Declarative Programming
2. Functional vs Non Function Programming
3. Pure vs Impure Functions
4. Higher order functions
5. Avoid using Iterators (for/while)
6. Avoid Mutability
7. Persistent data structures for efficient immutability - Using Immutable JS
